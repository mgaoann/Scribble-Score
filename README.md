# ✏️ Scribble Score

Scribble Score is a web application that checks handwriting consistency and offers feedback. Designed for kids, the user interface and dyslexia-friendly fonts make learning fun and accessible. This project was initially developed for [Boilermake XII](https://boilermake-xii.devpost.com/?_gl=1*qs70q6*_gcl_au*MjEzNTkxODYxLjE3Mzg4MTMxMzM.*_ga*MTg4MzQyOTQ3Ny4xNzM4ODEzMTMz*_ga_0YHJK3Y10M*MTc0MDUxOTUwNi4xMS4wLjE3NDA1MTk1NjYuMC4wLjA.).

Scribble Score scans a JPG or PNG and processes it to read the handwriting, then rates the legibility of handwriting based on parameters such as consistent spacing and straightness of lines.

### Built With:
- React - created the user interface for uploading handwriting images and displaying feedback
- Flask - managed API requests, processed images, and handled communication between front and backend
- OpenCV - preprocessed handwriting images including thresholding and contour detection
- Tesseract OCR - extracted text from handwriting samples
- NumPy - handled matrix operations and other numerical computations
- Matplotlib - generated visualizations

## Future Plans and Improvements
- Improve UI/UX - Further styling and polishing the page
- Expanded Handwriting Criteria - Developing new metrics for evaluation handwriting
- Enhanced Data Visualization - Adding more graphical representations of handwriting analysis
- Deployment - Hosting the project online
